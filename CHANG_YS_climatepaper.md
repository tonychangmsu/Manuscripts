##Historic and projected climate change in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem

###Introduction
With each passing year, the world has become more aware of the impacts of climate change. Evidence of the Earth's shifting climate patterns has become more perceptible from sea and surface temperature monitoring, satellite technology, and improve climate modeling.  At a relevant human scale, these changes are noted by recent hurricane events, high intensity wildfires, glacial retreat, and droughts at new unprecedented frequencies and magnitudes that have begun to reform the landscapes. Within the fifth annual Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change report (IPCC)  Within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), regional managers and citizens have experienced major disturbance  events that change the systems ecology through increased mountain pine  beetle attacks, wildfire events, and reduced annual snow pack. These disturbance beg the questions: 

1. How has climate changed within the GYE?
2. Are these events associated to climate change?
