##Historic and projected climate change in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem

###Introduction
With each passing year, the world has become more aware of the impacts of climate change. Evidence of the Earth's shifting climate patterns has become more perceptible from sea and surface temperature monitoring, satellite technology, and improve climate modeling.  At a relevant human scale, these changes are noted by recent hurricane events, glacial retreat, and droughts at new unprecedented frequencies and magnitudes that have begun to reshape the landscapes. Within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), regional managers and citizens have experienced major disturbance  events that change the systems ecology through increased mountain pine  beetle attacks, wildfire events, and reduced annual snow pack. With both the fifth annual Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change report (IPCC) and the latest US National Climate Assessment (NCA) reporting a decadal increases of gloabal temperatures at 1-1.2ºF and a continuing upwards trend, this begs the questions:

1. How has climate changed within the GYE?
2. Are these events associated to climate change?  

###History of Greater Yellowstone Climate 
From paleoclimate records of the GYE, changing climate in general is not unusal. The last major warm period occured during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene (12,000-8000 years ago), when the world saw the end of the last glacial maximum. The first major vegetation to move in was Engelmenn spruce, later followed by sub-alpine fir and whitebark pine, creating a widespread subalpine forest across the region. As conditions grew warmer and the glaciers reached their minimum (9500-7500 years ago) the region became was characterized by drier and warmer conditions that were XX $^o$F hotter and XX mm of precipitation drier.  At this period lodgepole pine and Douglas fir moved in from the more Southern landscapes, pushing the sub-alpine speces to higher elevations (Whitlock and Bartlein). Around 5000 years ago, the temperatures dropped and precipitation increased, converging towards the climate we recognize the GYE as having today.

###Recent climate within GYE
The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is a complex and facisnating region to study climate. The region homes some of the longest records of temperature and precipitation change anywhere in the US with some XX weather stations running since 18XX. Due to the complex mountain topography, with steep gradients, weather is highly heterogeneous across the region allowing events where specific mountain ranges can encounter 50mm of snowfall while another experiences 75ºF clear skies. Interest in snow science and variability across elevation has led to more than XX SnoTEL stations across XX mountain ranges. This provides scientists in the region with some of the highest density records of long term weather data of anywhere in the US. 

We draw on a data set called the Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model or PRISM (Daly 2002) to characterize past climate for the GYE. PRISM uses data from meteorological stations as input and interpolates between these stations based on topography and other factors and is often used as a standard gridded climate model for historic climate analysis at a regional scale. Since the 1900, mean annual temperature have increased by 1.1ºF/century, echoing the increased temperature change seen globally. Mean annual minimum temperatures, which indicate the coldest annual conditions, have increased more rapidly (1.5ºF/100 years) than the mean annual maximum temperatures (0.7ºF/century), which indicate the warmest daytime conditions. 

The GYE is subject to multiple-year periods of warmer and dryer conditions versus cooler and dryer periods. These cycles have been associated with a natural ocean dynamic termed Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which has been in place for centuries. Human-induced climatic warming is thought to be occurring on top of the PDO cycles, possibly accounting for the increasing temperature trend since 1900. The observed rate of temerature increase have been particularly pronounced since 1980. In fact, the rise in minimum temperatures in the last decade exceeds those of the 1930s Dust Bowl Era; although mean annual maximum temperatures ($T_{max}$) have not exceeded the historically recorded highs. This suggests that the major temperature changes that have occurred are primarily due to minimum temperature ($T_{min}$) rises. One manifestation of change in minimum temperatures is less extreme winter cold periods. Very cold winter monthly temperatures (<0°F) occurred about every six years prior to 1993, and have not occurred since then. 

Changes in temperature vary seasonally. $T_{min}$ increased in all seasons, most rapidly in summer and spring, and less rapidly in the fall. $T_{max}$ increased most rapidly in winter and spring, but experienced little change in fall. Precipitation has increased slightly since 1900 with a 9.3 mm/century increase. Drier-than-average years predominated prior to about 1940, and wetter-than-average years since then; however, these changes in precipitation are very small relative to the long-term average of about 800 mm/year.

The effect of precipitation on water availability is balanced by loss of moisture from evaporation and transpiration. The ratio of loss to potential evapotranspiration (PET) to the input from precipitation is a measure of aridity of the system. A plot of the aridity index for the GYE reveals that
aridity declined during the period between 1900 and 1977 and then began to increase (Figure 4). This suggests that in the last twenty five years, increases in precipitation have not be adequate to offset increases in PET that resulted from increases in temperature, and has resulted in the ecosystem becoming slightly more arid since 1977. The significant increase in minimum temperatures in the recent decades has also had an observable impact on snowpack. A reconstruction of April 1 snow water equivalent (SWE) for the period 1200-2000 (Pederson et al. 2011) found that current SWE across the GYE is ~20% lower than the long-term average; and the century between 1900 and 2000 is the longest period of below-average snowpack in the past 800 years. During the past century, snowpack was particularly low during the 1930s and 1990s.

Changes in temperature over the past century have also influenced stream flow and temperature. Stream discharge has declined during 1950-2010 in 89% of streams analyzed in the Central Rocky Mountains, including those in the GYE (Leppi et al. 2012). Reduced flows were most pronounced during the summer months, as illustrated by data from the Yellowstone River. Stream temperature across the range of the Yellowstone cutthroat trout, which includes the GYE, have warmed by 1ºC over the past century (Al-Chokhachy et al. 2013). Stream warming during
the decade of the 2000s exceeded that of the Great Dustbowl of the 1930s and represents the greatest rate of change over the past century.
