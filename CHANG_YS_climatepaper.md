##Historic and projected climate change in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem

###Introduction
With each passing year, the world has become more aware of the impacts of climate change. Evidence of the Earth's shifting climate patterns has become more perceptible from sea and surface temperature monitoring, satellite technology, and improve climate modeling.  At a relevant human scale, these changes are noted by recent hurricane events, glacial retreat, and droughts at new unprecedented frequencies and magnitudes that have begun to reshape the landscapes. Within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), regional managers and citizens have experienced major disturbance  events that change the systems ecology through increased mountain pine  beetle attacks, wildfire events, and reduced annual snow pack. With both the fifth annual Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change report (IPCC) and the latest US National Climate Assessment (NCA) reporting a decadal increases of gloabal temperatures at 1-1.2ºF and a continuing upwards trend, this begs the questions:

1. What is the historic climate of the GYE?
2. How has climate changed within the GYE?
3. Are these events associated to climate change?  

###History of Greater Yellowstone Climate 
From paleoclimate records of the GYE, changing climate in general is not unusal. The last major warm period occured during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene (12,000-8000 years ago), when the world saw the end of the last glacial maximum. The first major vegetation to move in was Engelmenn spruce, later followed by sub-alpine fir and whitebark pine, creating a widespread subalpine forest across the region. As conditions grew warmer and the glaciers reached their minimum (9500-7500 years ago) the region became was characterized by drier and warmer conditions that were XX $^o$F hotter and XX mm of precipitation drier.  At this period lodgepole pine and Douglas fir moved in from the more Southern landscapes, pushing the sub-alpine speces to higher elevations (Whitlock and Bartlein). Around 5000 years ago, the temperatures dropped and precipitation increased, converging towards the climate we recognize the GYE as having today.

###Recent climate within GYE (What is the historic climate of the GYE?)
The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is a complex and facisnating region to study climate. The region homes some of the longest records of temperature and precipitation change anywhere in the US with some XX weather stations running since 18XX. Due to the complex mountain topography, with steep gradients, weather is highly heterogeneous across the region allowing events where specific mountain ranges can encounter 50mm of snowfall while another experiences 75ºF clear skies. Interest in snow science and variability across elevation has led to more than XX SnoTEL stations across XX mountain ranges. This provides scientists in the region with some of the highest density records of long term weather data of anywhere in the US. 

We draw on a data set called PRISM (Daly 2002) to characterize past climate for the GYE. PRISM uses data from meteorological stations as input and interpolates between these stations based on topography and other factors. Mean annual temperature has increased 1.1ºF/100 years since 1900. Mean annual minimum temperatures, which indicate nighttime conditions, have increased more rapidly (1.5ºF/100 years) than mean annual maximum
temperatures (0.7ºF/100 years), which indicate daytime conditions. The GYE is subject to multiple-year periods of warmer and dryer conditions versus cooler and dryer periods These cycles have been associated with a natural ocean dynamic termed Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which has been in place for centuries. Human-induced climatic warming is thought to be occurring on top of the PDO cycles, possibly accounting for the increasing temperature trend since 1900. Rates of increase have been particularly pronounced since 1980. In fact, the rise in minimum temperatures in the last decade exceeds those of the 1930s Dust Bowl Era; although mean annual maximum temperatures (Tmax) have not exceeded the historically recorded highs. This suggests that the major temperature changes that have occurred are primarily due to minimum temperature (Tmin) rises. One manifestation of change in minimum temperatures is less extreme winter cold periods. Very cold winter monthly temperatures (<0°F) occurred about every six years prior to 1993, and have not occurred since then.

Changes in temperature vary seasonally. Tmin increased in all seasons, most rapidly in summer and spring, and less rapidly in the fall. Tmax increased most rapidly in winter and spring, but experienced little change in fall. Precipitation has increased slightly since 1900 with a 9.3 mm/century increase (Figure 3). Drier-than-average years predominated prior to about 1940, and wetter-than-average years since then; however, these changes in precipitation are very small relative to the long-term average of about 800 mm/year.
